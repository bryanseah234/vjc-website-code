					<description><![CDATA[While covid-19 may have meant VJC's Teachers' Day celebrations had to be carried online, teachers were left feeling no less encouraged and celebrated. Celebrations kicked off on 27 August morning with a classroom programme hosted by student emcees. Highlights of the programme included heartwarming performances by students, as well as a tongue-in-cheek video featuring different profiles of teachers put together by new teachers that had joined VJC in 2020, an internal teachers' only celebration planned by the Staff Welfare Committee and a specially catered lunch for teachers the following week on 3 September prepared by our very own Parent Support Group (PSG). While covid-19 may have changed the way in which school celebrations are run, it certainly hasn't taken away the good cheer and positivity that remain a fixture in schools as places of hope and promise.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On Fri 21 Feb 2020, the Cohort of 2018 returned to College to receive their A-Level results. Due to the ongoing Covid-19 situation, results release took place in the classrooms this time. Different as that was, the excitement of being back in College and meeting their peers was no less palpable. The results were also outstanding. The cohort attained a Median University Score (UAS) of 85, with 170 students achieving at least 6 distinctions, and 91 students achieving the highest possible UAS of 90. We congratulate all Victorians on their excellent achievements. Nil Sine Labore!]]></description>
